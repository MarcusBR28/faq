    "Answer Display": "Fire22 Needed Go to the sports user page and check Bet Details under the player's Pending Bet.\n\nAfter checking the conditions: if answer is 'no' but player is labeled as VIP: Escalate IF PROP BET: \n\nIF under 30 mins from bet placing: CANCEL, else continue:\n\nPrice will not show on sports app, Need simulate the bet on fire22 to visualize the current price. Once you have it check straight bet rules.\n\nHelp Sheet: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hc9th6BPRS0olx3mWShA4n8fxwsJGU9oYDZK_iiqNhw/edit?gid=0#gid=0\n\nIF while simulating, you're looking at the correct bet but the original line is no longer available:\n\nExample: https://prnt.sc/exwW9CdM24nC\n\nYou'll need to check if the line change made it easier or harder for the player to hit. In this example, the original line was +9.5 and when we tried to recreate it, it moved to +8.5. This means the line moved against the player since it's now harder to hit, so we can delete it. If the opposite had happened and the line moved from +9.5 to +10.5, it's now easier to hit, so we cannot delete it.\n\nIF the line has moved 1 point or more in favor of the customer (current line is easier to hit), then we're not deleting.\n\nElse: It can be deleted.\n\nIf can't find the price: Escalate IF FUTURES BET:\nEscalate IF it's a DYNAMIC LIVE bet: NO IF the Game has already Started: NO\n\n(Exception 2H bets: if game has started but bet is still available it means that it's not in 2nd half yet and we can still look at rules and try to cancel). IF it's a REPEATED / DUPLICATED BET:\n\nIF it's a Repeated Dynamic Live bet:\nTell the player:\n\"\nRepeat dynamic live bets will stand, win, lose, or draw. You must take caution to only bet one time and to check his pending bets before placing another bet. You cannot place a bet twice by hitting the \"Place Bet\" twice, if the first bet went in successfully, the player would have to choose the same game again and press \"Place Bet\" again in order for repeat bets to be made. It is not possible to click the \"Place Bet\" button twice without first clicking other screen selections.\n\"\n\nIF it's a Repeated Straight bet:\nFollow next step targeting the most recent bet: IF it's a STRAIGHT BET:\n1. IF line has moved less than 15 cents: YES\n\n2. IF has moved 15 or more:\n\n2.1 If the player is at a disadvantage (the current line now would cost more to win the same amount compared to the original bet): YES\n\nExample: +110 to -130 (40 cent difference but line costs more so we can cancel).\n\n2.2 Otherwise (player is at advantage): NO IF it's a SPREAD BET or TOTALS BET (Over / Under): \n\nEvery half point costs 10 cents. (0.5 pt = 10 cents)\nExample: the line: +3.5 -110 has the same value of +4.5 -130 resulting in a 0 cent difference.\n\nUse this to calculate the cents difference between lines then apply straight bet rules for cancelling. IF it's a PARLAY BET:\n0. Can't cancel a specific leg, has to be the whole parlay.\n\n1. IF any game of the parlay has already started: NO\n\n2. IF the average line difference of the bet lines of the parlay is 10 cents or less: YES\n\n3. IF the average is more than 10 cents:\nCheck which lines moved in favor / against the player:\n\n3.1 IF 50% or more of the lines moved against the player: YES\n3.2 ELSE: NO IF it's a TEASER:\nWe can cancel if the line didn't move in favor of the player. \nFor the full explanation: Check FAQ #602. ⚪IF WE CAN CANCEL:\n\n1. Press the trash icon on the correspondent pending bet line.\n2. Inform the player. ⚪IF WE CAN'T CANCEL:\n\nIF Lifetime net > 30K: Escalate\n\nELSE:\n\nTell the player \n\"\nSorry I can't delete this bet for you for Reason X\n\" Escalate",

Turn \"Can send P2P\" back on in the customer's account (if it was previously on). ◾IF Cash deposit:\n\n1. Go to 'Sports Agents' and open the agent's page.\n2. Briefly enable the agent bank by toggling on 'Agent Bank Enabled?' on the 'Toggles' tab on the far right.\n3.

    "Answer Display": "A teaser is a type of sports bet that allows bettors to adjust point spreads and totals potentially in their favor, increasing the likelihood of a winning outcome. However, there’s a catch. Similar to a parlay, a teaser requires bettors to win multiple legs.\nHere’s how a teaser works:\nSelection: A teaser must include at least two bets. The more legs added to a teaser, the higher the potential payout, but also the higher the risk.\nAdjustment: In a teaser, bettors can adjust multiple spreads or totals in an advantageous manner. The most common teaser is a six-point teaser, which allows you to add or subtract six points from a spread or total whichever way you want.\nOutcome: Every leg in the teaser must win for the bet to be successful. Even if only one game loses, the entire teaser is graded as a loss.\nFor example, let’s say the Philadelphia Eagles are +1.5 against the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots are +2.5 against the Miami Dolphins. A bettor likes these two lines but wants more protection, so they decide to place a two-leg six-point teaser. They move the Eagles’ line from +1.5 to +7.5 and the Patriots’ line from +2.5 to +8.5.",

Send this message to his agent:\n\"\nHey, customer [Sender UserID] is trying to send X amount to [Receiver UserID]. We need to know if the deposit was made or not because the receiver wants to change the address. Can you reach out to [Sender UserID] to verify if something was sent? Thank you.\n\"\n3.

    "Answer Display": "A. Teaser explanation:\n\nA teaser bet offers an alternative line on spread or totals and it's used as a parlay.\n\nThe user can selects the teaser type first (how many points are changed and on which sports), then selects what teams and if they want to bet on the spread or the totals.\n\nThe teaser ALWAYS adds favor to the bet.\n\nSome examples, In a 4 point teaser:\n- Spread bet -1 becomes +3\n- Total Over: 56 becomes O 52 (less points needed to win)\n- Total Under: 56 becomes U 60 B. Example of a Bet: \n\"Teaser (2 teams) Basic (6 pts FB, 4 pts BK)\"\n\nThis means the teaser select will affect 6 pts on football lines and 4 pts on Basketball lines.\"\n\nUser has the following bets:\n- Football Ravens/Bucaneers O 44 - For Game\n- Football Chargers +5 - For Game\n\nOriginal Lines Read:\nRavens Total (+50) -110 O\nChargers Spread -1 -110\n\nAs we can see here the teaser applied a 6 point to the total bet placed and 6 point to the spread bet. C. Bet DELETION RULES:\n\n1. Check if line has moved:\nThe way we check is to calculate the original line based on the teaser placed.\n\nExample user bet:\nTeaser 4 pt BK.\nBoston Celtics +6\n\nExample  1. Current Line:\nBoston Celtics Spread +2\n\nExample 2. Current Line:\nBoston Celtics Spread +5\n\nIn Ex. 1: Since the teaser must apply 4 points we can conclude that the line at the time of placing the teaser must have been +2 which is the same as the current line - therefore no line change.\n\nIn Ex. 2 we also know that the line at the time of placing the teaser was +2 but now current reads +5 - Line moved.\n\n2.A. If a line didn't move or it moved against the player : can delete.\n\n2.B. If the line moved in favor of the player (like Ex. 2): Escalate. Escalate",
